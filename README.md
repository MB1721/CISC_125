# CSIC_125
This repository holds several projects I made in my CSIC 125 course. I use these as starters to show off what I learned to do in college. Each project is centered around a specific programming concept such as classes, data structures, functions or algorithms. As such, no program here is appropriate is for real-world implementation. 

The code featured in these old projects does not reflect my current programming ability.
